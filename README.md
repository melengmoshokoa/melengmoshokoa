### Welcome! Feel free to look around—just don’t feed the bugs.

I’m Itumeleng, a passionate developer with a love for solving complex problems, writing (mostly) clean code, and creating cool projects. Whether it's building intuitive apps, hacking away on new frameworks, or teaching, I’m always up for a challenge!

    💻 Currently working on Moviehub - A mobile app for movie enthusiasts
    🌱 Learning more about the fascinating dynamics of human interaction, particularly how emotions such as love, and desire 
        influence behavior, relationships, and decision-making. I'm exploring the psychological and sociocultural 
        factors that shape these experiences to better understand their impact on personal and collective human experiences.
    🚀 Open to collaboration on open-source projects and exciting ideas
